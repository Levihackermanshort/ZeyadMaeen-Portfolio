# ZeyadMaeen-Portfolio




Changes completed:

Converted the entire portfolio to pure HTML and CSS
Created an animated star background effect using CSS instead of Three.js
Added floating orbs with CSS animations and gradients
Maintained all sections (Hero, About, Projects, Footer)
Included responsive design with media queries
Kept the clean, modern aesthetic with purple accent colors
Added smooth scrolling and header background change on scroll
Preserved the copyright line "Â© 2024 created by Zeyad Maeen"
Implemented fade-in animations using CSS keyframes
The main.js file now creates and injects a complete HTML document that contains all the necessary CSS and structural HTML. This approach means you get a fully featured, animated portfolio with zero JavaScript dependencies (except for the minimal header scroll effect).
